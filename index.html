        <h2>What I Do</h2>

<p>I deploy and administer servers for a large law firm with locations in multiple cities. Data-heavy work, virtualization, and database stuff are super interesting to me right now, and I like writing and working with quick, interesting web apps that take advantage of unusual data. I have varying degrees of experience with Javascript, Ruby, Python, various flavours of SQL, interacting with one of any number of APIs, and a little bit of everything else.</p>

<h2>Things I'm Interested In</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Harvesting old data for use in interesting apps, for example the things we can learn about how certain recipes and ingredients expanded through the world using only <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/SciRefGuides/americancookbooks.html">old church cookbooks</a> and seeing how recipes spread through North America</li>
  <li> Silly internet robots and applications that have questionable usefulness</li>
  <li> Urban gardening, especially projects like <a href="http://vegetablepatch.ca/">Vegetable Patch</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/">M-Turk</a> and other crowdsourced human interaction tasks and applications that use them</li>
  <li> All things related to ethical food and sustainability </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/USD451571">Duck Sword</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspic">The aspic craze of the early 20th century</a> </li>
  
</ul><h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I'm a chef-turned-computerman who loves looking at weird and silly data. I live in Ottawa, Ontario, where I've just recently gotten involved with <a href="http://opendataottawa.ca">Open Data Ottawa</a>, and I'm very excited to see where that leads. I also have a beard.</p>
