{"name":"Matt Leduc","tagline":"","body":"## What I Do\r\nI deploy and administer servers for a large law firm with locations in multiple cities. Data-heavy work, virtualization, and database stuff are super interesting to me right now, and I like writing and working with quick, interesting web apps that take advantage of unusual data. I have varying degrees of experience with Javascript, Ruby, Python, various flavours of SQL, interacting with one of any number of APIs, and a little bit of everything else.\r\n\r\n## Things I'm Interested In\r\n* Harvesting old data for use in interesting apps, for example the things we can learn about how recipes and ingredients expanded out using only [old regional church cookbooks](http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/SciRefGuides/americancookbooks.html) and seeing how recipes spread \r\n* Silly internet robots and applications that have questionable usefulness\r\n* Urban gardening, especially projects like [Vegetable Patch](http://vegetablepatch.ca/)\r\n* [Duck Sword](http://www.google.com/patents/USD451571)\r\n* All things related to ethical food and sustainability\r\n* [M-Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/) and other types of crowdsourced human interaction tasks and applications that use them\r\n* [The aspic craze of the early 20th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspic)\r\n\r\n## About Me\r\nI'm a chef-turned-computerman who loves looking at weird and silly data. I live in Ottawa, Ontario, where I've just recently gotten involved with [Open Data Ottawa](http://opendataottawa.ca), and I'm very excited to see where that leads. I also have a beard.","google":"40295295","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
